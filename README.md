## About

- My app helps solve the issues of cruelty in the cosmetics industry.

  > We provide beauty products that are not tested on animals and are 100% vegan.

- Beauty products can also help one regain confidence if we have facial scarring or just aren’t happy with our natural look.

  > Resulting in a happier, society, and therefore, a more successful community and economy.

- Dee’s cosmetics is a small business based in Vacaville, Ca and by supporting them, you help your local economy grow. 

    > In fact, studies show that for every $100 spent at a local business, $68 remained in the city while only $43 of each $100 spent at a chain retailer.
